Don't Repeat Yourself. One of the first lessons you learn in CS.

Standard libraries are designed to provide both an implementation that
can be commonly used and a reference for other libraries to design
themselves after. A similar effect occurs in many languages with
abstract classes and interfaces. A template to create other objects
from.

Python, like other languages, has inheritance as a built-in feature to
their classes, however sometimes you might desire to create a simple
template rather than a creatable class. Python's strength in being
dynamic becomes a major weakness when strictness is desired. However
Python 3 has added a new standard library to alleviate some of the
issues.

Abstract Base Classes are Python's solution to their dynamic to strict
problem. They are effectively both abstract classes and interfaces.
